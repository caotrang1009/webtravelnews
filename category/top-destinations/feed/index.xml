<p>Unlike the West, Asians specially value worshipping ancestors, therefore, there are so many customs and rules in worshipping of Vietnamese people. Today we will see the 2 major items in the worshipping custom of Vietnamese people in Tet holiday.</p>



<p>Tet is the most important event of a lunar year, on this occasion, people reunite and have lots of parties, so of course, tributes for ancestors cannot be lacked on those days. In Tet, people usually offer food 3 times a day to their ancestors as if they were alive and needed 3 meals a day as they do. However, the custom&nbsp;nowadays has been simplified a lot. Today in Tet they burn incense sticks all days on the altar but fresh food is only served once a day.</p>
